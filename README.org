* How to start
This project shows how to run ts-facemesh model in node env, by using opencv to
parse and load the image since we don't have HTMLVideoElement in node env

You need to install npm and node first

Put video file in the root directory and rename it to demo.mp4, then:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
npm i
node index.js
#+END_SRC

 The points will be in root directory as point.txt
